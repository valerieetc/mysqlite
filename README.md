# Welcome to My Sqlite
***

## Task
My Sqlite solves the task of making an sqlite simulation, complete with a CLI (command line interface).

## Description
The project contains two files - my_sqlite_request.rb and my_sqlite_cli.rb. The file my_sqlite_request.rb contains a class that allows to make several kinds of SQL requests within the file itself (see "Usage"). The file my_sqlite_cli.rb provides a CLI that allows to make the same kinds of SQL requests in the typical SQL format.
The kinds of requests handled by this project are:
SELECT (optional: JOIN ON, WHERE, ORDER BY)
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

## Installation
In order to run this project, Ruby needs to be installed. The CSV files that you want to work on must be placed in the same folder with the project files.

## Usage
TODO - How does it work?
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
